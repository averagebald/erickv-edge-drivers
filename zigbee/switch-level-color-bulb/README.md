# Edge Driver for Zigbee-based Bulbs

This is a _Zigbee-based Edge Driver_ that extends a little bit the default functionality of the _Sengled E11-G13_ Bulb.

Since this is the only _Zigbee Bulb_ I own, I can't guarantee whether it supports additional fingerprints or not, but it's worth trying, so submit your _Pull Requests_ anytime or ping me right away.
