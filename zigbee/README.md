# Zigbee Drivers for SmartThings Edge

The majority of the _SmartThings Edge Drivers_ that are supported at this repository were developed and tested on devices that are already compatible with _SmartThings_, with the exception of the [button-battery](./button-battery) and [led-strip-switch-color](./led-strip-switch-color) drivers that integrate non-certified products that support the _Tuya_ firmware.

**These drivers are available at the **[@erickv Shared Drivers](https://api.smartthings.com/invite/Q1jP18n4oZML)** channel.**

_(**Note**: You can also find in-develop edge drivers at **[dev-@erickv Shared Drivers](https://api.smartthings.com/invite/pbMvQvqgpGjO)** channel.)_

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to the members of the _SmartThings Community_ that not only helped me to
clarify a lot of Zigbee-specific concepts and inquiries, but also those that made this _Edge
Driver_ much more reusable and important that I was expecting. Again many thanks guys!
